UNIT CODES

0580 = SARGE

== HEADER spec ==
== TLAY 1 spec ==
== TLAY 2 spec ==
== OATT spec == (Bootcamp start offset-d: 288701)
4 bytes - OATT string
4 bytes - number of bytes in OATT block
4 bytes - number of elements in structure?
OATT BLOCK {
	NOTES
		* This is a structure of N bytes with some general data; varies per map
}

== MOVE spec ==
4 bytes - MOVE key string
4 bytes - (uint32) number of bytes in whole block (256x256, it seems)

NOTES
	* This appears to be the movement-allowance block, where each byte is a tile and each value is a uint8 representing tile height

== ELOW spec ==
4 bytes - ELOW key string
4 bytes - (uint32) number of bytes in whole block (256x256, it seems)

== TRIG spec ==
4 bytes - TRIG key string
4 bytes - (uint32) number of bytes in whole block (256x256, it seems)

NOTES
	* trigger zones? 1 byte per tile. Used to trigger events?

== BPAD spec ==
4 bytes - BPAD key string
4 bytes - (uint32) number of bytes in whole pad block (256x256, it seems)

* Read n bytes; note that this appears unused or generally empty?

== NPAD spec ==

4 bytes - NPAD key string
4 bytes - (uint32) number of bytes in whole pad block (256x256, it seems)
PAD BLOCK {
	1 byte - (uint8) Each byte coresponds to a single tile, where each value indicates the pad ID for the given tile.
NOTES
	* Likely from upper left to bottom right
	* Read n number bytes until whole block is processed
	* PADs can be given a named reference using the pad ID in the associated script in the form `PAD <codename> <padID>`
}

== SCEN spec ==


4 bytes - size of whole scenario block in bytes
4 bytes - total number of scenarios in block
16 bytes - scenario 1 name (null terminated)
FRACTION BLOCK {
	84 bytes - Fraction header (green -> tan -> blue -> grey)
{
	4 byte - separator (08 ASCII)
	4 byte - padding
	4 byte - uint32 - number of "reserved" rifle units number (squad number/para drops) - might just be 1 byte. No less than current number of rifle units in game, and breaks at too high a value
	4 bytes - number of grenaders
	4 bytes - flamers
	4 bytes - bazookas
	4 bytes - Technically "engineers" - but they look and act like regular rifles
	4 bytes - morters
	4 bytes - miners?
	4 bytes - specials?
	4 bytes - unknown - any change caused crash (usually '5') - maybe "Sarge"?
	4 bytes - unknown - any change caused crash (usually '3')
	4 bytes - min jeep units
	4 bytes - min tank units
	4 bytes - min half-track units
	4 bytes - unknown - crashed with value of 1 when zero in MP. Maybe truck/convoy?
	4 bytes - unknown - too low causes crash. No observable impact for high values. Maybe padding/space for special in specific maps
	4 bytes - uint32 - 0-3 - number of starting airstrikes
	4 bytes - uint32 - 0-3 - number of starting paras
	4 bytes - uint32 - 0-3 - number of starting supports
	4 byte - uint32 - number of units in fraction

NOTES

- In multiplayer, it appears that what matters is that the unit blocks have values. Placeholders for placement by human players are added based on the unit block values.
If you want to support placement for AI, then you must add an actual unit in addition to updating the placeholder block.

- Something in this header knows about the unit blocks - app crashes if new units added w/o mod to header, and crashes if mod to header
	
}
	UNITS BLOCK {
		16 bytes - unit header {
			1 byte - unit type ID (aligns with their position in the header block)
			1 byte - unit type CLASS
			2 byte - padding
			2 byte uint16 - pixel pos x
			2 byte - padding
			2 byte uint16 - pixel pos y
			2 bytes - unknown - seems unused
			1 byte - uint8 - rotation angle (0-255, counter-clockwise; where 0 = North, 255(360) = N, and 64(90) = West); doesnt seem to work for sarge
			1 byte - boolean - not placed (01) vs placed (00) - a value of not-placed in MP will allow human player to manually place; if AI, pos will be used and script can DEPLOY unit
			1 byte - uint8 number of men in unit - max 9? Possibly due to an internal array on the data type
			1 byte - uint8 - length of unit name string (including \n)
		}
		VARIYING - null-terminated unit name string
}
N+ FRACTION BLOCKS - read until EOF, or find byte of hex 08 (BS) after last unit string
84 bytes - scenario N header

FACT: Origin must be Upper Left. Maps are 256 x 256 tiles. Each tile is 16x16 pixels. This is 4096 pixels per row.
